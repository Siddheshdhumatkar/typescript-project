# Contributing to Postiz

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Postiz! Whether you're a first-time open source contributor or a seasoned maintainer, we appreciate your time and effort in making this project better.

## Getting Started

Before diving into this guide, we highly recommend you familiarize yourself with our [Developer Guide](https://docs.postiz.com/developer-guide). It provides an in-depth overview of the project structure and instructions on setting up your development environment. Once you're comfortable with that, this document will guide you through submitting your first contribution.

## Ways to Contribute

There are many ways to get involved and help improve Postiz:

- **Code improvements:** Fix bugs, enhance existing features, or introduce new ones.
- **Documentation updates:** Clarify existing documentation, correct errors, or add missing information.
- **Feature requests:** Suggest new capabilities or integrations that would improve the project.
- **Bug reports:** Identify and report bugs so they can be fixed.
  
Every contribution, no matter the size, is valuable and helps make Postiz better!

## Contribution Guidelines

### Writing Code with the Community

We strive to foster a welcoming and collaborative open-source community. Whether you're contributing a small fix or a new feature, we encourage you to interact with the community in the following ways:

- **GitHub Issues:** For more detailed or long-form discussions.
- **[Discord Chat](https://discord.postiz.com):** For quicker conversations, questions, or feedback.

#### General Rules

- **Small changes (<3 lines):** For small changes such as typos, dependency updates, or minor fixes, feel free to submit a pull request directly without prior discussion.
- **Larger changes (3+ lines):** If your contribution involves more substantial changes, it's best to open an issue or discuss it on Discord first. This helps ensure your contribution aligns with the project's roadmap and avoids potential disappointment if it can't be merged.

### Contribution Workflow

This project uses the Fork & Pull Request (PR) model. If you're unfamiliar with this process, here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Fork the repository:**  
   Create a personal copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.
2. **Clone your fork:**  
   Clone the repository to your local development machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/postiz.git
   ```
3. **Create a feature branch:**  
   Create a new branch to make your changes.
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. **Make your changes:**  
   Implement the changes you'd like to contribute.
5. **Push your changes:**  
   Once you've tested your changes, push them to your fork on GitHub.
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```
6. **Create a Pull Request:**  
   Go to your fork on GitHub and submit a pull request (PR) to the main Postiz repository. Include a clear title and description outlining the changes you've made and the reasons behind them.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Once your pull request is submitted, a project maintainer will review it. Depending on the complexity of the change, there may be suggestions for improvement, or it may be merged right away. 

If your PR requires further discussion, don't worry! We value collaboration and will work with you to get your contribution across the finish line.
